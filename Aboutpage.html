      <h3>What is Fast Fashion?</h3>
      <p>Fast Fashion is a widely unknown cyclic shopping routine that occurs as young consumers thrive off of quickly moving trends. With the urge to keep up with the latest designs, consumers encourage companies to use rapid production methods to supply trendy clothing at low costs — otherwise known as “fast fashion”. </p>

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>We want to stop Fast Fashion by providing people with alternative shopping options while also cultivating a community of smart shoppers. Through the map option, users have the chance to find ethical clothing stores while also finding donation spots. Our motton "shop. donate. earn." encourages users to shop and donate at ethical stores by earning points which can be redeemed for coupons.</p>
